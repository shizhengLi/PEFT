           1. Definitions.
        
              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
        
              "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
              the copyright owner that is granting the License.

              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

# Open Language Model Evaluation System (OLMES)

## Introduction

The OLMES (Open Language Model Evaluation System) repository is used within [Ai2](https://allenai.org)'s Open 
Language Model efforts to evaluate base and
instruction-tuned LLMs on a range of tasks. The repository includes code to faithfully reproduce the 
evaluation results in research papers such as
   * **OLMo:** Accelerating the Science of Language Models ([Groeneveld et al, 2024](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ac45bbf9940512d9d686cf8cd3a95969bc313570))
   * **OLMES:** A Standard for Language Model Evaluations ([Gu et al, 2024](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c689c37c5367abe4790bff402c1d54944ae73b2a))
   * **TÜLU 3:** Pushing Frontiers in Open Language Model Post-Training ([Lambert et al, 2024](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/T/%22ULU-3%3A-Pushing-Frontiers-in-Open-Language-Model-Lambert-Morrison/5ca8f14a7e47e887a60e7473f9666e1f7fc52de7))
   * **OLMo 2:** *Reference coming soon*

The code base uses helpful features from the [lm-evaluation-harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness) 
by Eleuther AI, with a number of modifications and enhancements, including:

  * Support deep configurations for variants of tasks
  * Record more detailed data about instance-level predictions (logprobs, etc)
  * Custom metrics and metric aggregations
  * Integration with external storage options for results


## Setup

Start by cloning the repository and install dependencies (optionally creating a virtual environment,
Python 3.10 or higher is recommended):
```
git clone https://github.com/allenai/olmes.git
cd olmes

conda create -n olmes python=3.10
conda activate olmes
pip install -e .
```

For running on GPUs (with vLLM), use instead `pip install -e .[gpu]`. If you get complaints regarding the 
`torch` version, downgrade to `torch>=2.2` in [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml).

## Running evaluations

To run an evaluation with a specific model and task (or task suite):

```commandline
olmes --model olmo-1b --task arc_challenge::olmes --output-dir my-eval-dir1
```

This will launch the standard [OLMES](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c689c37c5367abe4790bff402c1d54944ae73b2a) 
version of [ARC Challenge](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/88bb0a28bb58d847183ec505dda89b63771bb495) 
(which uses a curated 5-shot example, trying both multiple-choice and cloze formulations, and reporting
the max) with the [pythia-1b model](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/pythia-1b), storing the output in `my-eval-dir1`

Multiple tasks can be specified after the `--task` argument, e.g.,
```commandline
olmes --model olmo-1b --task arc_challenge::olmes hellaswag::olmes --output-dir my-eval-dir1
```

Before starting an evaluation, you can sanity check using `--inspect`, which shows a sample prompt
(and does a tiny 5-instance eval with a small model)
```commandline
olmes --task arc_challenge:mc::olmes --inspect
```
You can also look at the fully expanded command of the job you are about launch using the `--dry-run` flag:
```commandline
olmes --model pythia-1b --task mmlu::olmes --output-dir my-eval-dir1 --dry-run
```

For a full list of arguments run `olmes --help`.


## Running specific evaluation suites

### OLMES standard - Original 10 multiple-choice tasks

To run all 10 multiple-choice tasks from the [OLMES paper](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c689c37c5367abe4790bff402c1d54944ae73b2a):
```
olmes --model olmo-7b --task core_9mcqa::olmes --output-dir <dir>
olmes --model olmo-7b --task mmlu::olmes --output-dir <dir>
```

### OLMo evaluations

To reproduce numbers in the [OLMo paper](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ac45bbf9940512d9d686cf8cd3a95969bc313570):
```
olmes --model olmo-7b --task main_suite::olmo1 --output-dir <dir>
olmes --model olmo-7b --task mmlu::olmo1 --output-dir <dir>
```

### TÜLU 3 evaluations

The list of exact tasks and associated formulations used in the [TÜLU 3 
work](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/T/%22ULU-3%3A-Pushing-Frontiers-in-Open-Language-Model-Lambert-Morrison/5ca8f14a7e47e887a60e7473f9666e1f7fc52de7) 
can be found in these  suites in the [task suite library](oe_eval/configs/task_suites.py):
   *  `"tulu_3_dev"`: Tasks evaluated during development
   * `"tulu_3_unseen"`: Held-out task used during final evaluation

### OLMo 2 evaluations

The list of exact tasks and associated formulations used in the base model evaluations of the 
[OLMo 2 technical report]()
can be found in these suites in the [task suite library](oe_eval/configs/task_suites.py):
   * `"core_9mcqa::olmes"`: The core 9 multiple-choice tasks from original OLMES standard
   * `"mmlu:mc::olmes"`: The MMLU tasks in multiple-choice format
   * `"olmo_2_generative::olmes"`: The 5 generative tasks used in OLMo 2 development
   * `"olmo_2_heldout::olmes"`: The 5 held-out tasks used in OLMo 2 final evaluation



## Model configuration

Models can be directly referenced by their Huggingface model path, e.g., `--model allenai/OLMoE-1B-7B-0924`,
or by their key in the [model library](oe_eval/configs/models.py), e.g., `--model olmoe-1b-7b-0924` which
can include additional configuration options (such as `max_length` for max context size and `model_path` for
local path to model).

The default model type uses the Huggingface model implementations, but you can also use the `--model-type vllm` flag to use
the vLLM implementations for models that support it, as well as `--model-type litellm` to run API-based models.

You can specify arbitrary model arguments directly in the command line as well, e.g.
```commandline
olmes --model google/gemma-2b --model-args '{"trust_remote_code": True, "add_bos_token": True}' ...
```
To see a list of available models, run `oe-eval --list-models`, for a list of models containing a certain phrase,
you can follow this with a substring (any regular expression), e.g., `oe-eval --list-models llama`.


## Task configuration

To specify a task, use the [task library](oe_eval/configs/tasks.py) which have
entries like
```
"arc_challenge:rc::olmes": {
    "task_name": "arc_challenge",
    "split": "test",
    "primary_metric": "acc_uncond",
    "num_shots": 5,
    "fewshot_source": "OLMES:ARC-Challenge",
    "metadata": {
        "regimes": ["OLMES-v0.1"],
    },
},
```
Each task can also have custom entries for `context_kwargs` (controlling details of the prompt),
`generation_kwargs` (controlling details of the generation), and `metric_kwargs` (controlling details of the metrics). The `primary_metric` indicates which metric field will be reported as the "primary score" for the task.

The task configuration parameters can be overridden on the command line, these will generally apply to all tasks, e.g.,
```commandline
olmes --task arc_challenge:rc::olmes hellaswag::rc::olmes --split dev ...
```
but using a json format for each task, can be on per-task (but it's generally better to use the task 
library for this), e.g.,
```
olmes --task '{"task_name": "arc_challenge:rc::olmes", "num_shots": 2}' '{"task_name": "hellasag:rc::olmes", "num_shots": 4}' ...
```
For complicated commands like this, using `--dry-run` can be helpful to see the full command before running it.

To see a list of available tasks, run `oe-eval --list-tasks`, for a list of tasks containing a certain phrase,
you can follow this with a substring (any regular expression), e.g., `oe-eval --list-tasks arc`.

### Task suite configurations

To define a suite of tasks to run together, use the [task suite library](oe_eval/configs/task_suites.py),
with entries like:
```python
TASK_SUITE_CONFIGS["mmlu:mc::olmes"] = {
    "tasks": [f"mmlu_{sub}:mc::olmes" for sub in MMLU_SUBJECTS],
    "primary_metric": "macro",
}
```
specifying the list of tasks as well as how the metrics should be aggregated across the tasks.


## Evaluation output

The evaluation output is stored in the specified output directory, in a set of files
for each task. See [output formats](OUTPUT_FORMATS.md) for more details.

The output can optionally be stored in a Google Sheet by specifying the `--gsheet` argument (with authentication
stored in environment variable `GDRIVE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`).

The output can also be stored in a Huggingface dataset directory by specifying the `--hf-save-dir` argument, 
a remote directory (like `s3://...`) by specifying the `--remote-output-dir` argument,
or in a W&B project by specifying the `--wandb-run-path` argument.
